# Data Project - Business Intelligence


This Database / Business Intelligence project, called "Le Palais du Bonbon", aimed at setting up a database hierarchy, developing a candy order generator, optimizing the production of candies and packages, optimizing the package chain of candies, and optimize the delivery of these.

### Prerequisites

Python Library:

```
cx_Oracle
```
To install it, please do the following:

```
pip install cx_Oracle
```

### How to use the Generator 

Open a Console Prompt, navigate to the root folder of your Githib Project. Then, enter the Python Shell by doing:

```
python
```
And then, import the generator by doing
```
import generator
```
And finally,
```
generator.generateOrderPool(nbOrders) 
```
where nbOrders is the number of orders you want to generate.

NB: do not forget to copy the file
```
local_config_example.py
```
to
```
local_config.py
```
at the root of your project, and change its values.
